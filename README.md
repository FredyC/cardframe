CardFrame - Card games framework
=========

Javascript framework for testing, developing and playing games based on cards.

Goal of this system is to have simple and scalable framework, that can be extended in many ways and allow to define different set of game cards, decks or areas on game board.

Initially there will be limited rendering engine for the browser. However framework should allow to create various outputing methods. That essentially means ability to play same game session using various devices like mobile or even console.

There will be downloadable development kit using https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit. Later it should be also used for hosting game sessions.
